# Project One - Smart Letter Box

The Smart Letterbox is a device that serves the same purpose as a traditional mailbox, only here it is done in a user-friendly way. And all of this with just a few sensors and an LCD display!

First of all, you don't have to check your mailbox every day yourself, the Letterbox does it for you! Should there be mail, you will see a notification on the LCD-display.

Another feature is that you no longer need keys to access your mailbox. Scan your registered badge and the door opens.

You can see and perform the same actions on the website app. In addition, you can add new users or delete existing ones to give or deny them access to your mailbox.

## Programs
Before you start, let me introduce you to the languages that have been used for this project.
-[Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) is being used for writing the back-end
-[JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) is being used for writing the back-end
-[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) creates your website
-[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) gives the design to your website
## Database
In this [map](https://github.com/howest-mct/2021-2022-projectone-mbarkouagoulla/tree/master/database-export) you will find the sql-file of my database.
You can simply download it. After that you will have to open MySQL Workbench and open the sql-file you just downloaded. Just run the sql-script and the database will be generated and will be shown in the sidebar. 

## Back-end
In the backend [map](https://github.com/howest-mct/2021-2022-projectone-mbarkouagoulla/tree/master/backend) are all the scripts prepared for running the application once you've assembled all the components. The main program is the app.py. That's the script that you will have to run. There is also a calibr_servo.py code, this can be used for calibrating the servo-motor if you want to mount it in a different place on the case.

## Front-end
Here in the [front-end](https://github.com/howest-mct/2021-2022-projectone-mbarkouagoulla/tree/master/front-end) you will have to change nothing. This is just for your information in case you want to know how the website is structured and what pages there are. 

## Fritzing
[Here](https://github.com/howest-mct/2021-2022-projectone-mbarkouagoulla/tree/master/fritzing_schema) are the schematics located that you can use when assebmling all the components. While assembling and connecting the components, feel free to follow the steps on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Smart-Letterbox-1/)
  
## Instructables
Before you start with the software and code, do the practical part first! [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Smart-Letterbox-1/)
